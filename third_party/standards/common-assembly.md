# Common assembly

## Scope and authority

The owner approved a thin optional `@get-modular/assembly` package. Core remains
pure and unchanged. Assembly depends only on the public Core root; Host supplies
already selected and authorized factory functions; capability types come from
contract descriptors ([ADR-0032](../decisions/0032-give-assembly-an-authoring-builder-and-capability-scoped-handles.md)).
Construction success does not establish readiness, trust or permissions.

One construction feature owns handles, preparation, sequential execution and the
authoring builder.
No service locator, global service registry, discovery, dynamic imports,
scheduler, retry, automatic rollback, disposal, readiness, generations or hot
replacement. The internal Core emitter remains private and required-only.

## Consumer module standard

[ADR-0026](../decisions/0026-adopt-consumer-module-standard.md) accepts this
central authoring and adoption contract. It applies to new composition boundaries
inside a consumer's explicitly accepted Host scope. It does not migrate a product
or certify existing code merely because that product installs Assembly.

### Authority and identity

The organization [Feature Module Standard v1](feature-module-standard.md#adoption)
remains the sole authority for semantic ownership, layers, feature layout,
dependency mechanisms and extraction. Its immutable identity is Git blob
`d0bfff2033faf544fe65268c1dcdfd524d093015`, SHA-256
`851653f96643cf0466b67ab22963661976b00de44840fa3144a48a8c054f95fa`.
The linked local profile maps Get Modular itself, not all consumers.

The [current contract](current-contract.md) and this Assembly contract own graph
compilation, exact bindings, preparation and construction handoff. Host owns
permissions, readiness, lifecycle decisions and cleanup authority; modules
register their own cleanup through the optional resources package. The local accepted adoption
ADR and consumer profile own concrete roots, composition owners, package pins,
legacy boundaries, exceptions and actual verification commands. None may weaken
organization rules or infer repository-wide conformance from one adopted slice.
Foundation remains this repository's source classifier and dependency policy
engine; this standard does not introduce another import parser.

A consumer pins this document's repository, path, anchor, exact Git commit and
SHA-256 of the complete document bytes, plus its accepting ADR identity. Keep
this one current document; package SemVer, compatibility tokens, profile schema
versions and document content pins are different identities. Local copies are
non-authoritative evidence only.

### New composition boundaries

Every new production capability needs a semantic owner. A bounded context,
package, feature and Assembly handle need not map one-to-one. Inside accepted
Host scope, independently assembled capabilities, alternative implementations
and configurable inter-module relationships must use consumer-owned ports and
a single Core/Assembly composition root. A local adoption can make this optional
library mandatory for that scope.

Fixed library dependencies and private helpers inside a cohesive feature remain
static imports and typed factories. A parser, mapper, DTO, class or endpoint is
not a graph node merely because it is new. Cover real composition seams, not a
quota of handles. Each wiring relationship uses one organization dependency
mechanism. Static composition does not imply runtime plugin discovery; runtime
selection, variable dependencies or independently managed lifecycle require an
explicit demonstrated need for the runtime mechanism.

Keep declarations, profiles and handle mapping in the outer composition adapter.
Domain and application code must not import Core, Assembly, registration types,
SDK or transport DTOs, or selected concrete port implementations. Features expose
narrow typed factories and consumer-owned dependency records. Preserve owned
Published Language and anti-corruption boundaries; shared domain identities or
generic repositories are not justified by similar code alone.

There is one production composition authority: the profile selects bindings,
owner-local factories materialize capabilities, and Host receives closed roots.
Do not retain a second direct production assembly, instance fallback, string
lookup, mutable registry, global container or registration-order semantics.
Keep capability IDs and revisions in contract descriptors owned by the contract
owner ([ADR-0032](../decisions/0032-give-assembly-an-authoring-builder-and-capability-scoped-handles.md));
declarations reference descriptors and never spell compatibility. Preserve literal
inference; production wiring must not use `any`, double casts through `unknown`
or broad casts to hide capability, token or slot mismatches. A justified exact
exception needs an accepted rationale and a rejecting test; it cannot authorize
a false type claim.

Construction may be async without making domain APIs async. Preserve Host-owned
cleanup, the created journal and untransferred returned-product handoff. Do not
introduce a generic lifecycle manager for passive construction. Module-registered
cleanup uses the optional resources package; see
[Module resource scopes](#module-resource-scopes).

### Optional dynamic Host lifecycle candidate

[ADR-0029](../decisions/0029-admit-an-optional-lifecycle-kernel-candidate.md)
admits `@get-modular/lifecycle-kernel` only as a candidate shared policy package.
The Host still owns trusted artifact admission, literal imports, grants,
product generation IDs, readiness, routing, async work, resource handles,
cleanup and recovery. Core/Assembly do not import the kernel. This does not
change a passive composition scope or certify Agent Runtime dynamic adoption.

For an explicitly adopted dynamic scope, keep inert selected declarations
separate from executable loaders. Reject the **whole selected graph** for
namespace, capability, binding or loader mismatch before any candidate import.
The Host creates a strong construction-attempt owner before the first import,
reserves custody before each possible acquisition, and checks live call and
product authority again after awaits and immediately before effects. Kernel
call/custody leases are bookkeeping identities, not artifact grants or cleanup
tickets. New admission closes at quiesce; ordinary effects close at retirement.
Private owner cleanup may continue afterward without restoring plugin authority.
An observer timeout never releases held work or proves physical disposal.

Record source SHA, exact package/archive hashes, this standard's full-document
SHA-256 and retained copy, TEST/production classification and real rejecting
commands in the consumer profile. A synthetic TEST Host can demonstrate these
races but cannot establish production adoption or G1 public qualification.
Until those gates and a product's local adoption decision pass, classify the
dynamic boundary as pending. Retained consumers that initiate **new** calls
after owner retirement are outside the first kernel contract; supporting them
requires a successor decision, separate evidence and product policy rather
than treating custody as invocation authority.

### Module resource scopes

[ADR-0030](../decisions/0030-admit-the-module-resource-scope-package.md) admits
the optional `@get-modular/resources` package. It is a cleanup mechanism: a
module registers how to release what it acquired, and the Host decides when a
scope closes, how long to wait, when to escalate or abandon, whether to retry
and how to report health. Core and Assembly do not import it. Pure and
borrow-only modules need nothing.

A scope is cooperative cleanup of trusted in-process code. `complete: true`
means every registered cleanup callback returned without throwing; it is not
proof of physical release. `Debt.path` is an array; join it only for display.

Module authors:

1. Acquire through `resources.setup`, or pass a value already in hand to
   `resources.use`. Acquire asynchronously only inside `setup`: after a close is
   requested `use()` throws and the value stays with you. Never close a
   dependency received through a slot; it is borrowed.
2. Name every entry and child scope. Names form the debt paths that Hosts
   alert on.
3. Everything a cleanup needs is a declared slot or the module's own resource.
   Hidden dependencies break the order; independent modules are ordered by
   implementation ID, not by intent.
4. Give a child scope only ports whose setup completed before the child was
   created. Never pass `Resources` of an ancestor or any `ScopeControl` down.
5. When subscribing to a provider, register the returned disposer in your own
   scope.
6. Running work is not a resource. Register dependencies, then the drain set,
   then the subscription, so release runs unsubscribe, drain, close; or make
   each operation a `child()`.
7. A domain shutdown protocol, such as retire, settle and delete in a fixed
   order, stays inside one cleanup. A scope orders independent entries; it
   does not replace an authority sequence.
8. A cleanup throws only when its resource may still be held. Its `escalate`
   signal asks for a faster release; it never permits skipping one.
9. `use()` releases bluntly: `Writable` is destroyed, `ChildProcess` only
   receives SIGTERM, `http.Server` waits for active requests. Use the README
   recipes that react to the escalation signal.
10. Wrap a thenable resource: `setup: () => ({ proc: execa(...) })`.
11. Domain and application code never sees `Resources`; only the composition or
    adapter layer of the module does. Only `scoped()` reads `FactoryContext.scope`;
    never cast it.
12. Never await `close()` of your own or an ancestor scope inside a cleanup.
13. A cleanup that must not run twice guards itself; the Host may retry.

Host template (policy belongs to the Host, not to the library):

<!-- consumer-standard-example: host -->

```ts
import { assemblyFor, declareModule, defineContract, type Assembly, type CapabilitiesOf, type ModuleFactory } from "@get-modular/assembly";
import { required } from "@get-modular/core";
import { scoped, type CloseReport, type ModuleContext, type Resources, type ScopeControl } from "@get-modular/resources";

// Contract owners publish one descriptor per capability.
export const Db = defineContract<DbPort>()({ id: "acme/db", revision: 1 });
export const Orders = defineContract<OrdersPort>()({ id: "acme/orders", revision: 1 });

// A module package: no wire literals, typed only by the contracts it uses.
export const ordersDeclaration = declareModule({
  moduleId: "acme/orders", implementationId: "acme/orders/default",
  owner: { authority: "acme", path: ["orders"] },
  provides: [Orders.provide()], slots: [Db.slot("db", required())],
});
export const createOrders: ModuleFactory<
  CapabilitiesOf<typeof Db | typeof Orders>, typeof ordersDeclaration, Connection, ModuleContext
> = async (deps, { resources }) => {
  const conn = await resources.setup({
    name: "conn",
    setup: ({ signal }) => connect(url, { signal }),
    cleanup: (c) => c.close(),
  });
  return { instance: conn, capabilities: { "acme/orders": createOrdersPort(deps.db, conn) } };
};

// The Host: policy belongs here, not in the library.
export async function closeWithin(
  control: ScopeControl, graceMs: number, abandonMs: number,
): Promise<CloseReport> {
  const escalate = new AbortController();
  const abandon = new AbortController();
  // Referenced timers keep the process alive until the Host has a report.
  // Abandon ends only this wait: the scope keeps releasing in order.
  const toEscalate = setTimeout(() => { escalate.abort(); }, graceMs);
  const toAbandon = setTimeout(() => { abandon.abort(); }, graceMs + abandonMs);
  try {
    return await control.close({ escalate: escalate.signal, abandon: abandon.signal });
  } finally {
    clearTimeout(toEscalate);
    clearTimeout(toAbandon);
  }
}

// The composition root is a function of Assembly, so `smoke` can pass its own api.
export function composeOrders(api: Assembly<CapabilitiesOf<typeof Db | typeof Orders>>) {
  // A Host-local stand-in; module packages export their factory as createOrders does.
  const database = api.bindFactory(declareModule({
    moduleId: "acme/db", implementationId: "acme/db/pg",
    owner: { authority: "acme", path: ["db"] }, provides: [Db.provide()], slots: [],
  }), async () => ({ instance: undefined, capabilities: { "acme/db": { query: () => 0 } } }));
  const orders = api.bindFactory(ordersDeclaration, scoped(ordersDeclaration.implementationId, createOrders));
  return api.prepare({ composition, factories: [database, orders], roots: { orders } });
}
// Bind and prepare once; every run gets its own scope.
const preparation = await composeOrders(assemblyFor<CapabilitiesOf<typeof Db | typeof Orders>>());
if (preparation.status === "failed") { throw new ConstructionFailed(preparation); }
const { prepared } = preparation;

export async function construct(host: Resources, signal: AbortSignal) {
  const attempt = host.child({ name: "attempt" });
  const outcome = await prepared.run({ signal, scope: attempt.resources });
  if (outcome.status !== "succeeded") { // run() has settled: no factory is running
    throw new ConstructionFailed(outcome, await closeWithin(attempt.control, 5_000, 5_000));
  }
  return { roots: outcome.roots, lifetime: attempt.control }; // transfer ownership with control
}
```

Host rules:

- Wrap owning factories with `scoped(implementationId, factory)` and pass one
  scope per run: `run({ signal, scope: attempt.resources })`, never the `Scope`
  itself. Never capture a scope when binding factories. Close the attempt only
  after `run()` settles. Load exactly one copy of `@get-modular/resources` per
  Host.
- Pass construction cancellation to `run({ signal })`. `scoped()` stops a
  module's setups when it aborts, until the factory settles.
- Keep singletons shared across attempts in the Host scope.
- Use one deadline at the root: escalate first, then abandon, with referenced
  timers. Abandon never means released; the snapshot has `settled: false`,
  debts stay in the scope, and a later `close()` after the flight completed is
  an explicit retry.
- Release continues past a failed entry. When a cleanup may need a provider
  again on retry, such as an audit log that cleanups write to, keep
  that provider in an outer scope and close the outer scope only after the
  inner report is complete.
- Use `child({ order: "concurrent" })` only for a scope whose entries are
  independent peers, such as sessions, turns or instances; everything else
  stays in reverse order.
- Drain or stop running work before closing the scope that holds its
  resources; deciding that work has stopped is Host policy.
- Transfer ownership by transferring `control`.
- A dynamic Host that uses the lifecycle kernel (candidate, ADR-0029) retains
  custody before `child()` and releases it only after the child's report is
  complete.

Out of scope: release order derived from the graph, reference-counted sharing,
durable recovery, dependency-loss health contracts, lifecycle hooks, plugin
managers and process or worker control.

### Dynamic instances

[ADR-0031](../decisions/0031-pass-a-per-run-scope-and-declared-inputs-to-assembly-runs.md)
lets one prepared assembly, called a template below, serve many instances. Get Modular has no live graph
mutation, rebinding, hot replacement or code unloading.

- An instance is one `run()` of a prepared template under its own scope with
  its own inputs. Prepare a template once and keep it at the highest level that
  outlives all its runs; it holds no run state. Key a cached template by the
  plan digest together with the identity of its factory set; the digest alone
  does not cover factories.
- Reserve an instance synchronously by creating its scope with `child()` before
  the first await, then run with that scope's `resources`. Close the instance
  scope after a failed or cancelled `run()` settles. Publish roots only after a
  successful run and transfer the instance's lifetime by transferring its
  `control`.
- Replace an instance by running a new one, switching the owner's pointer and
  closing the old one. A change of any module inside an instance rebuilds the
  whole instance; split an instance that is too coarse into nested templates.
- Pass per-instance data and parent ports as inputs: declarations without
  slots bound with `bindInput`, one capability each. Each run supplies them in
  `run({ inputs })` as plain records keyed by capability ID; a value may be a
  port. Never pass them through closures captured at bind time. An input must
  outlive every instance that received it. Roots of an instance do not escape
  its owner except through a facade.
- The factory context stays closed: `{ signal, scope }` from Assembly and
  `{ signal, resources }` inside `scoped()`. An input is data or one narrow
  port, never a registry with `get(key)` or a bundle of parent services. More
  than about eight inputs on one template is a reason to review its boundary.
- Keep instances that share a key in a Host map with single-flight creation;
  eviction is Host policy. Hold many independent instances under a parent
  scope created with `order: "concurrent"`.
- Tenant variants keep one stable base template; a variant lives in a nested
  template with its own inputs.
- Callers outside the owner reach a replaceable instance through one facade
  capability: begin a call, invoke, release, and refuse with an explicit
  unavailable result after retirement. Do not wrap ports in a generic Proxy.
  With the lifecycle kernel candidate, activate the new instance, switch the
  route and quiesce the old one in one synchronous step, drain by the Host's
  deadline, retire and close it, and release kernel custody only when the
  close report is complete.

<!-- consumer-standard-example: instances -->

import { assemblyFor, declareModule, defineContract, type Assembly, type CapabilitiesOf, type ModuleFactory } from "@get-modular/assembly";
import { required } from "@get-modular/core";
import { scoped, type ModuleContext, type Resources } from "@get-modular/resources";

const SessionId = defineContract<{ readonly id: string }>()({ id: "acme/session-id", revision: 1 });
const Chat = defineContract<ChatPort>()({ id: "acme/chat", revision: 1 });
interface Capabilities extends CapabilitiesOf<typeof SessionId | typeof Chat> {}

const sessionInput = declareModule({
  moduleId: "acme/session", implementationId: "acme/session/input",
  owner: { authority: "acme", path: ["session"] }, provides: [SessionId.provide()], slots: [],
});
export const chatDeclaration = declareModule({

  owner: { authority: "acme", path: ["chat"] },
  provides: [Chat.provide()], slots: [SessionId.slot("session", required())],
});

export const createChat: ModuleFactory<Capabilities, typeof chatDeclaration, ChatPort, ModuleContext> = async (deps, { resources }) => {
  const lease = await resources.setup({
    name: "lease", setup: () => acquireLease(deps.session.id), cleanup: (held) => held.release(),
  });
  const port = createChatPort(lease);
  return { instance: port, capabilities: { "acme/chat": port } };
};

// The template root is a function of Assembly, so `smoke` can pass its own api.
export function composeSessions(api: Assembly<Capabilities>) {
  const session = api.bindInput(sessionInput);
  const chat = api.bindFactory(chatDeclaration, scoped(chatDeclaration.implementationId, createChat));
  return api.prepare({ composition, factories: [chat], roots: { chat }, inputs: { session } });
}
// Prepared once; each session is one run with its own scope and input.
const preparation = await composeSessions(assemblyFor<Capabilities>());
if (preparation.status === "failed") { throw new ConstructionFailed(preparation); }
const { prepared } = preparation;

// `sessions` is host.child({ name: "sessions", order: "concurrent" }).
export async function openSession(sessions: Resources, id: string, signal: AbortSignal) {
  const instance = sessions.child({ name: "session:" + id }); // reserved before the first await
  const outcome = await prepared.run({
    signal, scope: instance.resources, inputs: { session: { "acme/session-id": { id } } },
  });
  if (outcome.status !== "succeeded") { // closeWithin is the Host deadline helper from Module resource scopes
    throw new ConstructionFailed(outcome, await closeWithin(instance.control, 5_000, 5_000));
  }
  return { chat: outcome.roots.chat, lifetime: instance.control }; // the caller owns the instance
}
```

### Module packages and contracts

[ADR-0032](../decisions/0032-give-assembly-an-authoring-builder-and-capability-scoped-handles.md)
gives Assembly the authoring builder.

Contracts:

- A contract owner publishes one descriptor per capability with
  `defineContract<Value>()({ id, revision })` from a contract package that
  holds descriptors and port types, not implementations.
- Raise `revision` with every change of the value type, additive changes
  included, and never change what a published revision means. A capability ID
  is permanent: do not start a parallel line such as an ID ending in `/v2`.
- In the current wire generation a provider and every consumer of a capability
  use the same revision, and Core rejects a mismatch as
  `binding.compatibility-mismatch`. A later generation adds a window of
  consumer revisions that a provider still serves; declarations and maps
  written with the builder keep working, only the builder and Core change.
- A module package lists the contract packages it provides or consumes as
  ordinary dependencies; that version fixes the revision the module was built
  against. Whenever a contract package raises a revision, it releases a version
  that a caret range does not accept: a new minor while it is 0.x, a new major
  from 1.0.
- Declare port members as function-typed properties, not methods: TypeScript
  checks method parameters bivariantly and accepts a breaking change silently.

Module packages:

- Declarations use `declareModule` with `Contract.provide()` and
  `Contract.slot(slotId, cardinality)`. Never write `kind`, `schemaVersion` or a
  `compatibility` literal by hand; the builder emits the current wire
  generation.
- A module package exports its declaration and an unbound factory typed
  `ModuleFactory<CapabilitiesOf<its contracts>, typeof declaration, Instance, ModuleContext>`;
  the composition root binds it. It never imports the Host's map.
- Name a map derived from many contracts as an interface:
  `interface HostCapabilities extends CapabilitiesOf<typeof A | typeof B> {}`.
  A type alias over hundreds of contracts multiplies check time and reaches
  TS2589 on TypeScript 5.8.3.
- A Host prepares with a map that contains every capability any handle uses,
  with the identical contract.
- Module packages list Get Modular packages only in `peerDependencies`, with a
  range of one 0.x minor such as `^0.3.0`, and pin exact versions in
  `devDependencies` for their own tests. A Host installs one copy of each Get
  Modular package. Widen a range only when the release notes of the newer
  minor say that the authoring surface did not change.
- Identify errors by `code`, never by class or message:
  `assembly.<area>.<reason>`, `resources.<area>.<reason>` and
  `conformance.<area>.<reason>`. Core diagnostics carry their catalog codes in
  `Diagnostic.code`.

### Identity and namespaces

Core validates identity syntax and rejects collisions inside one compilation;
it authenticates nothing.

1. A namespace is one or more leading whole segments of a portable ID.
   Membership holds only at a segment boundary,
   `id === namespace || id.startsWith(namespace + "/")`, so `agent` never covers
   `agent-runtime/x`.
2. `moduleId` and `implementationId` lie in the namespace of the product that
   supplies the code. Within one release of that product, declarations with
   different slots or provides never share an `implementationId`, even in
   different compositions. A module keeps its `implementationId` across
   releases, also when a later release changes its slots or provides, and
   raising a contract revision keeps every `implementationId` that uses it.
3. A `capabilityId` lies in the namespace of the contract owner, the product or
   context that defines the port, not of the provider. The owner publishes the
   descriptor and, for a contract that others implement, its suite and fake.
4. A namespace names a stable semantic owner, a product or bounded context,
   not a team, repository, package or directory. Inside it, use
   paths such as `<product>/<context>/<name>`.
5. IDs are immutable and never reused. A renamed module or contract is a new
   identity migrated through complete profiles. Core and Assembly have no
   aliases and no override by ID.
6. `owner.authority` is a navigation label equal to the first segment of
   `moduleId`. It confers no ownership or permission.
7. Session, tenant and instance IDs never enter module IDs; they name scopes
   or run inputs.

### Testing modules

[ADR-0033](../decisions/0033-admit-the-module-conformance-kit.md) admits the
kit `@get-modular/conformance`.

1. Export each module factory as a named `ModuleFactory` typed by the module's
   own contract map, and bind the same function in production, wrapped with
   `scoped()` when it registers resources.
2. Type fakes with `FactoryDependencies<C, typeof declaration>`. No `any`,
   `as never` or double cast on a dependency record.
3. The contract owner keeps one fake per contract that others implement and a
   suite created with `contractSuite(contract, cases)`, published from an
   entrypoint that production code does not import. The fake and every
   implementation pass that suite through `runContractSuite`, which takes any
   `(name, body)` registrar as `test`, such as `node:test` `test` or Vitest `it`.
   From inside a `node:test` test, pass `(name, body) => t.test(name, body)`; an
   unbound `t.test` crashes. A suite covers errors and cancellation,
   not only success, and is required once a capability has two implementations,
   the fake included.
4. Test one module with `isolate(api, { declaration, factory, dependencies })`
   and release it with `await using`; a debt fails the test.
5. Write each production composition root as a function of `Assembly<C>`. One
   `smoke` test per root prepares it once, fails and aborts construction at
   every module and requires every attempt scope to close complete. Bind every
   factory of the root through the `api` that `smoke` passes to `compose`:
   `smoke` rejects when a factory is bound elsewhere, because it never sees an
   injection. Effectful leaves use their owners' fakes.
6. `smoke` does not prove wiring. Keep the independent binding oracle from the
   table above, and never derive expected bindings from the profile or the
   implementation.
7. `guardHandles` is a per-file diagnostic, and `complete` is not proof of
   physical release. Check real adapters in disposable TEST projects.
8. Close every scope a test creates. No sleeps; use the test runner's
   timeouts and mock timers for deadlines.

### Scoped acceptance and evidence

An adopting consumer must provide an accepted local decision and a profile with:

- Central document and organization authority pins; exact reviewed package and
  lock/archive identities under existing package policy.
- Declared production roots, active wiring scope, owner, materialized entrypoint,
  declaration/profile/factory paths, dependency mechanism and test mapping.
- Exact existing legacy boundaries and direct relationships, marked `not-adopted`,
  with rationale, owner and review trigger. This inventory is not an FMS
  violation baseline and must not weaken an existing activation's prohibition
  on grandfather lists.
- Exact accepted exceptions with rule, paths, owner, rationale, decision and
  review trigger. No wildcard, blanket directory exemption or automatic legacy
  inventory expansion. Reject stale entries.
- Actual blocking commands, reciprocal references and evidence for the precise
  claimed slice. Package installation or a successful library test is not
  consumer adoption evidence.

At activation, the consumer gate must discover new production boundaries through
its existing topology/source inventory. Unknown boundaries fail until explicitly
adopted or classified. New cross-module or replaceable relationships inside a
legacy boundary require current adoption or an exact accepted exception. An
ordinary fixed-dependency classification is valid only inside its owning feature.
The gate must reject drifted pins, missing paths, removed/no-op command chains and
unknown or stale exceptions. These requirements become an enforced consumer claim
only with positive and rejecting fixtures in that consumer's fast and full gates.
This documentation checkpoint does not claim that a consumer checker exists.

Evidence includes unchanged existing FMS scope, adopted wiring, allowed private
helpers and declared legacy; rejection of unknown boundaries, new direct legacy
edges, invalid exceptions, pin drift and forbidden layer imports; typed rejection
of wrong capability/token/slot and a missing await on an async Host constructor; independent
binding parity, zero factories on preparation failure, attempt isolation and
Host failure/cancellation ownership; and packed imports through public roots on
exact approved artifacts in a disposable directory. Semantic review must also
look for new capabilities hidden inside existing functions: a static inventory
does not prove all ownership or domain design rules.

### Executable examples and adoption status

The existing [synthetic Host source](../../tests/assembly/fixture.mjs)
and [runtime assertions](../../tests/assembly/runtime.test.mjs) exercise
required, optional and ordered-many bindings, sharing and Host cleanup.
[Preparation regressions](../../tests/assembly/preparation.test.mjs)
check invalid wiring before effects; [typed fixtures](../../tests/assembly/types.test.mjs)
and the [packed consumer](../../tests/assembly/packed-consumer.mjs)
cover the public carrier. The [resource scope tests](../../tests/resources/assembly-scope.test.mjs),
[input tests](../../tests/assembly/inputs.test.mjs), [builder tests](../../tests/assembly/builder.test.mjs),
the [template compile test](../../tests/assembly/consumer-standard-examples.test.mjs)
for the examples of this document and the [packed conformance consumer](../../packages/conformance/tests/packed-root.test.mjs)
extend them. These belong to the existing `pnpm assembly:test`, `pnpm resources:check`
and `pnpm conformance:check` commands, invoked by both fast and full gates, after
`pnpm assembly:build`.
Consumers must additionally link their own executable slice and independent
binding oracle; copied Markdown examples do not count as evidence.

Agent Runtime has accepted static Core/Assembly adoption for passive setup and
ordinary-session composition in [Agent Runtime PR #168](https://github.com/agent-teams-ai/agent-runtime/pull/168),
merged as `3cd722f607e1643b809f6946ee303a5a94469171`. This reciprocal reference
records only that accepted passive scope; contained-turn and dynamic plugin
runtime scope are not admitted. The consumer records its current standard pin
in its own profile.
Core self-composition and synthetic/packed Hosts remain library evidence, not
independent production consumers. This reference does not establish
repository-wide conformance. Full legacy conversion and shared checker
extraction require separate scope.

## API and metadata ownership

`assemblyFor<C>()` selects capability value and compatibility identities at type
level; `C` is a Host map or a module's own map, usually derived with
`CapabilitiesOf`. It stores no service registrations or instances.
`bindFactory(declaration, asyncFactory)` returns an identity-authenticated handle.
A private WeakMap holds handle metadata; copying descriptors, symbols or prototype
cannot forge a handle. This is identity checking, not code authorization.

`bindFactory` synchronously snapshots declaration metadata and captures the
function before returning. The original is neither frozen nor read again.
Preparation and execution use this same snapshot. Mutation from required to many
must never change an existing callback's injection contract. Malformed metadata
causes a stable binding error before any factory call; Core owns semantic rules.

`prepare({ composition, factories, roots, inputs })` accepts a successful Core
result, the exact selected factory handles, an alias-to-root-handle mapping and an
alias-to-input-handle mapping. Factory and input handles together are unique and
cover every selection exactly once; an input handle appears only in `inputs`,
under one alias, and is never a root (`assembly.prepare.input-handles`); an uncovered
selection stays `assembly.prepare.handles`. Each root
has exactly one alias and refers to the same supplied handle. No extra handles or
alias getters.

A handle is invariant in the capabilities its declaration uses: preparation
accepts it only when each of them has the identical value and compatibility type
in the preparing map, and every capability any handle uses is part of that map.
Literal declaration inference is controlled by
the declaration, not widened by the callback. Required slots yield `T`, optional
slots an own field `T | undefined`, and many slots a frozen `readonly T[]`.
Widened declarations do not confer a statically precise injection contract.

Factories receive only their closed dependency record and `{ signal, scope }`.
`scope` is the value passed to `run()`; Assembly delivers it unchanged and never
inspects, awaits, freezes or disposes it. Each
fulfills with `{ instance, capabilities }`. Instance is for Host, including roots
without provides. Capabilities has exactly the declaration's own capability keys.
Injection selects by provider implementation ID AND capability ID, never instance
as fallback. A present capability with value `undefined` is distinct from a missing
key. Different capabilities and instance may be three different objects.

## Preparation and resource envelope

Before the first await, capture the successful result, handle list, root map and input map.
Inspect own data descriptors, dense arrays and exact shapes without invoking
getters. Pre-count individual and aggregate sizes before proportional copying.
Reject unexpected keys before projecting the supplied plan into a profile.

The local carrier ceiling for the supported Core pair is: 4096 handles, selections and
order entries; 1024 roots; 65536 bindings; 1024 providers per row; 262144 provider
occurrences overall. Declarations have at most 64 provides and 128 slots each,
65536 of each overall; owner paths at most 8 segments. Every metadata identifier
has at most 128 UTF-8 bytes. Root and input aliases are each bounded to 128 UTF-8 bytes and 1024
entries. Validate alias own-key counts too. These are structural allocation
ceilings, not another graph engine. No private Core imports. Changes to supported
Core require rechecking this table against its successful-plan envelope.

Restore a complete profile from the captured plan and invoke public
`compileComposition` on captured handle declarations. Compare the entire returned
plan and digest to the supplied snapshot, including every ordering, capability and
compatibility field. Core alone validates grammar, cardinality, graph closure and
canonical order. Use fixed-schema comparison, not user `toJSON`/serialization.
No product factory is called until every binding and root passes. Expected
preparation failures return a discriminated result, preserving Core diagnostics
separately. Unexpected pre-effect internal errors may reject preparation.

Prepared state contains only immutable instructions and function references.
Metadata is cooperative Host-owned data. Reflection on executable Proxy objects
may run code; these are not safe data. Modified intrinsics, arbitrary heap pressure
and a fixed wall-clock bound are outside the contract. No raw-byte input ceiling
is misrepresented as an enriched plan ceiling.

## Execution and Promise carrier

`prepared.run({ signal, scope, inputs })` is async and sequential in
dependencyOrder. Every input is checked before the first factory. Exactly one
invocation per selected non-input implementation per attempt; an input value is
borrowed for the attempt. Many injection preserves
providerImplementationIds order. Diamond consumers share capability references
within an attempt; repeats, concurrent and finite nested runs have separate maps,
ordered journals and cursors. Host factories may themselves return singletons;
assembly cannot guarantee otherwise.

Dependencies, many arrays, metadata and journals belong to assembly and are
frozen. Dependency/capability records have null prototypes and exact own keys.
Instance objects, capability values, causes, closures and signals remain opaque,
are not deeply frozen, logged or copied. Library internals never await a nested
capability, including one with a callable `then`.

The supported factory carrier is a current-realm Promise with ordinary
Promise.prototype and no own string properties, under unmodified intrinsics.
Own symbol data properties used by Node async context tracking are permitted and
ignored; symbol accessors are rejected without invocation. Inspect
its prototype/own descriptors before intrinsic Promise observation; reject a
constructor getter without invoking it. Direct thenable objects and subclasses are not
supported or assimilated. Intrinsic observation verifies the internal brand.
Observe fulfillment inside a safe ordinary wrapper, never resolving another
Promise with the raw product. Promise resolution performed by the factory itself
(for example `async () => thenable`) is factory execution and outside the library's
no-assimilation promise.

## Outcomes and ownership transfer

Outcomes are closed unions: succeeded with typed roots and created; failed with
phase, stable code, implementation ID when applicable, original cause and created;
cancelled with reason and created. A failed outcome separately records observed
cancellation. Phase `inputs` reports invalid run inputs
(`assembly.run.invalid-inputs`) before any factory call. Inputs never appear in
created. Each created entry carries module ID, implementation ID, instance and a
snapshot of its capabilities, in creation order.

Immediately after fulfillment, retain the raw current product until its journal
entry is committed. Malformed completion or an internal error in this interval
returns previous created AND the same untransferred returned product/implementation
ID. After commit it appears exactly once in created. No later factory or library
cleanup runs after failure. Memory exhaustion preventing the failure result itself
and process termination are outside this handoff guarantee.

Resources not returned by a rejected factory belong to that factory or its
Host-owned resource owner. Host defines cleanup policy. The optional resources
package gives that owner an ordered mechanism; Assembly still performs no
disposal. A journal entry is not a
claim of independent resource ownership: do not dispose the same shared resource
through provider, consumers and multiple capability references.
The resource owner is known before construction handoff and registers cleanup
at acquisition; receiving a capability gives no cleanup authority. An async
provider remains responsible for allocations it fails to hand back. A one-shot
Host uses roots within their protected lifetime and returns an inert summary
after cleanup, not graph references to the closed scope. Opaque failure causes
remain opaque; a summary does not certify that those causes contain no references.

A new profile does not update previously delivered references. Construction
success remains distinct from Host readiness and lifecycle publication.

An already aborted signal yields cancelled with no calls. Check before each
factory and before success commit. Await an already running factory after abort;
no Promise.race with cancellation. Valid late fulfillment is recorded in the journal then returns
cancelled; rejection, invalid fulfillment or an internal error returns failed,
with cancellation recorded separately. An uncooperative pending factory can keep
run pending; Host owns deadlines and isolation. Terminal outcomes do not change.

## Delivery phases and ownership

- A0: record ADR/package admission and this reviewed contract. Preserve accepted
  history. Integrator owns documentation, authority and repository-wide guards.
- A1: implementation worker owns packages/assembly and its private build entry.
  Include manifest, workspace dependency, tsconfigs, build/typecheck/test commands
  and source mapping alongside the first substantive preparation code. No run stub
  or unusable standalone checkpoint. Integrator connects shared root gates.
- A2: same feature owner implements execution and the synthetic vertical slice.
  A1/A2 may be one coherent review checkpoint when the public API needs both.
- A3: packed consumer, minimum/build TypeScript checks, final independent review,
  docs and full repository gate. No publication or real Agent Runtime migration
  follows merely from this assembly implementation checkpoint.

The synthetic Host has store, filters a/b sharing store, and root app with required
store, optional logger and ordered-many filters [b,a]. Prove order-dependent output,
then a second profile with logger and reversed many. Show Host-owned cleanup after
failure without duplicate resource disposal. Core's retained consumer example is
historical evidence and is not overwritten.

## Definition of done

- Full-plan tampering, missing/duplicate/extra/forged handles, incomplete roots and
  late invalid bindings refuse with zero factory calls. Digest/order/capability
  changes refuse. Explicit absent optional binding is required.
- Snapshot mutation after bind and immediately after prepare cannot change wiring;
  getter counts stay zero for supported malformed records.
- Test individual boundary/plus-one sizes and aggregate provider overflow before
  compiler calls, including actual Core acceptance at the supported upper bound.
- Required/optional/many shapes, several distinct capabilities, roots without
  provides, sharing, many order and defined-undefined values behave as specified.
- Pending factories prove sequentiality; repeated/concurrent/nested attempts stay
  isolated. No import-time product factory calls or runtime fallback.
- Throw, primitive rejection, malformed completion, controlled internal failure
  before journal commit, and every abort/settlement ordering preserve ownership.
- Reject unsupported direct thenable and own-constructor-getter Promise without
  executing either; opaque instance/capability then methods remain untouched.
- Positive typed consumer uses no wiring casts/any; negative fixtures reject wrong
  capability/compatibility, undeclared slots, mutable many, widened declarations,
  callback inference widening and incompatible mappings. Test minimum TS 5.8.3 and
  pinned build compiler, resolver modes, and a large literal declaration fixture;
  builder-generated declarations, fragment handles bound under different maps,
  rejection of unknown capabilities, and a 500-handle fragment fixture on both
  compilers.
- Packed-root consumer installs only supported files/dependencies and runs the
  synthetic Host. Core never imports assembly; no development tooling leaks.
- Focused assembly gates, check:changed, check:fast, one final full check and
  independent exact-source review pass. Record evidence and remaining limitations.

## Historical Core evidence and current admission

The [assembly admission checker](../../architecture/checks/assembly-admission.mjs)
authenticates ADR-0023 and the admitted manifest before separating Assembly paths
from the unchanged Core scope. Under
[ADR-0024](../decisions/0024-separate-historical-m2-lock-custody-from-current-dependencies.md),
current admission checks the exact workspace importers and Assembly-to-Core edge;
root tooling resolutions evolve under current dependency and frozen-install gates.
The separately authenticated historical M2 lock witness preserves the original
ledgers, verifier and retained test bytes. The legacy direct reader retains its
strict reconstruction without coupling current admission to the historical lock.

[Admission regressions](../../tests/assembly-admission.test.mjs) reject graph drift,
changed authority and packages outside the admitted scope. The current
[retained replay adapter](../../tests/assembly-admission-retained.test.mjs) preserves
the historical cases and explicitly proves that the old verifier still rejects
current lock bytes without the authenticated transition. This finite transition
does not itself establish current installation readiness or change historical evidence.

Public Assembly 0.1.0 admission additionally authenticates
[ADR-0025](../decisions/0025-publish-assembly-0-1-0-with-core-0-1-0.md).
Historical private admission retains its original authority. Publication follows
retained-byte and registry consumer checks; admission alone proves no release.
Public 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 pair admission additionally authenticates
[ADR-0027](../decisions/0027-admit-the-core-and-assembly-0-2-0-correction-pair.md) and
[ADR-0031](../decisions/0031-pass-a-per-run-scope-and-declared-inputs-to-assembly-runs.md) respectively.
